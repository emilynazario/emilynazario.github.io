I am a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department studying in the Integrative Carnivore Ecophysiology Lab with Dr. Terrie Williams. My research interests are at the intersection of marine predator physiology, biogeography, and targeted, area-based conservation and management using a combination of experimental, computational (e.g., species distribution modeling, spatial statistics), and social science approaches. I am also a student in the coastal science and policy designated emphasis program. Through this program, I work to understand how to connect science to conservation needs and management applications.
